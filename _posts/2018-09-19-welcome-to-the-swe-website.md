I'm honestly surprised this isn't already a thing, but here it is... a website by SWEs for SWEs.

## Why?

Throughtout my degree, I often found myself making bad decisions based on advice from profs and advisors. It's not their fault, they give the best advice they can, but unless they are or recently were a student, it's tough for our advisors to know exactly what's best for us.

For the same reason, advice from other students was often the best advice. What to take for electives, when to take which courses, what to do when co-op terms screw up your beautiful SWE course matrix... Answers to all of these questions were always best answered by my fellow students.

So I thought _why not create a SWE website?_ This way everyone can contribute their advice in the hopes that it may be useful for future students, showcase projects you're working on, and more.

This is also my way of paying it forward and helping new SWE students.

## Contribute

Contributing to this project is a great way to learn about git, contributing to open source, and Jekyll (the static site generator running this thing)!
