# About

This site is meant to be maintained by current and past SWE students from UNB to collect and share advice on how the best get through the degree.

## Why?

I often found myself making bad choices based on bad advice from profs and advisors. They would do their best to give good advice but it's hard as a professor to know what it's like to be a on the other side as a student and therefore hard to give reliable advice. On the otherhand, advice from other students about which courses to take, when to take them, who to contact about what, etc. was often great advice. 

So I thought _why not create a SWE repo?_ So I did. This way everyone can contribute their stories and advice in the hopes that it may be useful for future students. This is also a great way to learn about git, contributing to open source, and Jekyll (the static site generator running this thing)!
